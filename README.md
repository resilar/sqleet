Compiling
---------

SQLite3 shell with sqleet encryption support can be compiled as follows:

```sh
    % # UNIX
    % gcc sqleet.c shell.c -o sqleet -lpthread -ldl

    % # Windows
    % gcc sqleet.c shell.c -o sqleet
```

[Example](#example) illustrates sqleet encryption using the compiled shell.

To use sqleet as a library, the recommended way is to download a preconfigured
[release package](https://github.com/resilar/sqleet/releases/latest) instead of
cloning the master. The contained `sqleet.c` and `sqleet.h` files are drop-in
replacements for the official `sqlite3.c` amalgamation and `sqlite3.h` header.
The C interface of the sqleet encryption extension is described in section
[SQLite3 encryption API](#sqlite3-encryption-api).

Run `./script/amalgamate.sh <sqleet.c >amalgamation.c` to produce amalgamation
of custom SQLite3/sqleet version with encryption support.


Cryptography buzzwords
----------------------

- PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 key derivation algorithm with a 16-byte random salt and
  12345 iterations.
- ChaCha20 stream cipher with one-time keys.
- Poly1305 authentication tags.

A low-level description of the encryption scheme is available in
[sqleet.c:144](sqleet.c#L144).


Example
-------

Encrypting a database with a password "swordfish".

```
[sqleet]% hexdump -C hello.db

```

The database can only be read with the correct password.

```
[sqleet]% ./sqleet hello.db 
SQLite version 3.20.1 2017-08-24 16:21:36
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> .dump       
PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF;
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
/**** ERROR: (26) file is not a database *****/
ROLLBACK; -- due to errors
sqlite> PRAGMA key='swordfish';
sqlite> .dump
PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF;
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
CREATE TABLE hello(x);
INSERT INTO hello VALUES('Hello, world!');
COMMIT;
```

If the target database has a non-default page size (i.e., other than 4096),
then `page_size` must be initialized accordingly with `PRAGMA` before setting
the encryption key. See [Remarks](#remarks) for more information.


SQLite3 encryption API
----------------------

sqleet defines `SQLITE_HAS_CODEC` at the compile time to expose SQLite3's 
`sqlite3_key()` and `sqlite3_rekey()` functions for managing encryption keys.

```c
SQLITE_API int sqlite3_key(      /* Invoked by PRAGMA key='x' */
  sqlite3 *db,                   /* Database to key */
  const void *pKey, int nKey     /* Key (password) */
);
```

`sqlite3_key()` is typically called immediately after `sqlite3_open()` to
specify an encryption key for the opened database. The function returns
`SQLITE_OK` if the given key was correct; otherwise, a non-zero SQLite3 error
code is returned and subsequent attempts to read or write the database will
fail. Note that the first page of the database is read from the disk in order
to validate the key.

```c
SQLITE_API int sqlite3_rekey(    /* Invoked by PRAGMA rekey='x' */
  sqlite3 *db,                   /* Database to rekey */
  const void *pKey, int nKey     /* New key (password) */
);
```

`sqlite3_rekey()` changes the database encryption key. This includes encrypting
the database the first time, decrypting the database (if nKey == 0), as well as
re-encrypting it with a new key. Internally, `sqlite3_rekey()` performs a
`VACUUM` to encrypt/decrypt all pages of the database. The return value is
`SQLITE_OK` on success and a SQLite3 error code on failure.

In addition, there are `sqlite3_key_v2()` and `sqlite3_rekey_v2()` functions
that accept the target database name as the second parameter. By default, the
main database is used.

#### Raw keys

**Disclaimer**: The current interface is experimental and likely to change in
future versions (see issue #13 for discussion). Use at your own risk!

The encryption functions pass the provided key string (password) to a key
derivation algorithm (i.e., PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with a 16-byte salt and 12345
iterations). Optionally, the user can bypass the key derivation by specifying a
raw key in format `raw:K` where `K` is a 32-byte binary string or a 64-digit
hex-encoded string. This is useful in programs that use sqleet as a library and
want to handle key derivation by themselves. Additionally, the raw key string
can also be followed by a 16-byte (or 32-hexdigit) salt which is stored in the
beginning of the database file (otherwise a random salt is generated).
**Warning:** In any way erroneous raw key (e.g., unsupported length or invalid
hex-encoding) results in the key being handled as a normal key including the
`raw:` prefix. Moreover, specifying a salt makes sense only when creating a new
database or re-encrypting an existing database, because otherwise the specified
salt is overridden by the salt stored in the database file.


Android support
---------------

sqleet does not have an out-of-the-box support for Android. However, [SQLite
Android Bindings](https://www.sqlite.org/android/doc/trunk/www/index.wiki)
project provides an easy way to bundle a custom SQLite3 version (such as
sqleet) into an Android application with the standard Android interface
[`android.database.sqlite`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/sqlite/package-summary).
In particular, see [Using The SQLite Encryption
Extension](https://www.sqlite.org/android/doc/trunk/www/see.wiki) page for
build & usage instructions.


Remarks
-------

The contents of an encrypted database file are indistinguishable from random
data of the same length. This is a conscious design decision made in sqleet,
but as a drawback, database settings cannot be read directly from the database
file. Thus, it is the user's responsibility to guarantee that the settings are
initialized properly before accessing the database. Most importantly, if the
database page size differs from the default value of 4096, then the user must
explicitly set `page_size` to the actual value (using, e.g., `PRAGMA` command)
or otherwise opening the database will fail regardless of correct key.

In contrast, the official [SQLite Encryption Extension
(SEE)](https://www.sqlite.org/see) leaves the bytes 16 through 23 of the
database header unencrypted so that specific information, including the page
size, can be read from encrypted databases - with the obvious cost of making
database files distinguishable from random. sqleet can optionally be compiled
with the same behavior by giving `-DSKIP_HEADER_BYTES=24` flag at compile time
(the value 24 only skips the encryption of the bytes 16 through to 23 because
the first 16 bytes contain a plaintext salt anyway).


Versioning scheme
-----------------

[sqleet releases](https://github.com/resilar/sqleet/releases/) follow a
perverse form of semantic versioning which requires some explanation. Major
version number increments indicate compatibility breaks as usual, but the minor
& patch version numbers match the targeted SQLite3 version. For example, sqleet
v0.25.1 corresponds to SQLite v3.25.1. Although the target SQLite3 version is
the primarily supported, sqleet is typically forward and backward compatible
across different SQLite3 versions without any changes to the source code.


License
-------

Like SQLite3, sqleet has been released in the public domain (specifically,
under the [UNLICENSE](https://unlicense.org/) license). In other words, feel
free to do whatever the fuck you want to with the code. In the unlikely case
that your country's legal system is broken with respect to public domain
software, contact `def@huumeet.info` for a custom-licensed version.
